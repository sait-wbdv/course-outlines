## Course Learning Outcomes
### 1. Apply the JavaScript language to enhance web pages.
- Explain the history and purpose of JavaScript.
- Describe the structure of a simple JavaScript script.
- Describe how JavaScript is integrated into a web page.
- Identify the JavaScript variable data types.
- Use variables in a JavaScript program.

### 2. Use complex control structures to modularize scripts and control the flow of the running script.
- Describe the syntax of conditional statements.
- Explain how the different types of loop structures can be used.
- Employ functions to make a script modular with re-usable blocks of code.
- Demonstrate the use of parameters and return statements to customize functions.

### 3. Use JavaScript objects to make richer web pages.
- Explain what objects are and why they are used in JavaScript.
- Describe the purpose of object methods and properties.
- Discuss the types of objects that are part of the browser’s JavaScript engine.
- Demonstrate how objects are created and used in a script.
- Demonstrate how to control JavaScript objects on a web page.
- Explain the purpose and structure of Array objects.

### 4. Write scripts that perform event handling and form validation.
- Explain Form tags and the related form objects that are generated when a page loads.
- Describe the various event handlers that intercept user interaction with the web page.
- Use event handlers to activate JavaScript functions.
- Use JavaScript for controlling form submission.
- Apply JavaScript to validate form data before submitting it to the server.

### 5. Write scripts that use built-in browser objects.
- Identify various objects that are available in the browser.
- Discuss the various methods and properties available for working with these objects.
- Use these built-in objects within scripts to enhance the web page functionality.

### 6. Write scripts that store, retrieve, update, and delete data using browser localStorage, and trigger events using timers.
- Explain how localStorage are used to store data in the browser and make it available to the server.
- Use localStorage to persist web page data beyond a single request.
- Demonstrate how to create, modify and delete localStorage.
- Demonstrate the use of timers to control repetitive events in a script.

### 7. Use advanced JavaScript to add animation and complex functionality to pages.
- Describe advanced features of JavaScript.
- Explain how the sizing and positioning features of Cascading Style Sheets can be accessed and modified from JavaScript to create dynamic animation features.
- Use Cascading Style Sheet positioning, the Document Object Model, and JavaScript event handling to build dynamic HTML features into a web page.

### 8. Use Asynchronous JavaScript and JSON to make web pages dynamic.
- Explain how tags such as “div” can be controlled to provide dynamic size, position, and contents changes after the main page is loaded.
- Describe the mechanism used by JavaScript to communicate asynchronously with servers and update page regions.
- Use the Fetch API to dynamically update web page regions using asynchronous communications with web servers.

### 9. Use Object-Oriented patterns to structure web applications.
- Create objects, assign properties and call methods.
- Use inheritance to extend and modify behaviour of an existing class.
- Create objects that perform useful functions in a web application context.

### 10. Construct simple server-side programming scripts with variables and decision structures.
- Explain the history and purpose of Node.js.
- Demonstrate the ability to set up a backend environment.
- Use operators, built-in functions, and control structures to generate a web page.

### 11. Apply modular design to scripts.
- Explain the purpose of modular design.
- Create modules and express code modularity in an application.
- Use 3rd-party packages to add functionality to a web application.

### 12. Create scripts that receive and process web form data.
- Describe the request/response cycle used for transferring data between clients and servers.
- Create web forms in an HTML page and send data to a server.
- Generate a success page or an error page depending on data validity.

### 13. Construct web applications leveraging open source components to streamline development.
- Install, configure and deploy a framework-based web application.
- Describe the features and components that frameworks provide and when they would be used.
- Use frameworks to handle routing, form validation, authentication and persistence.
- Explain the MVC pattern and why you would use it.
