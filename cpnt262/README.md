    - Describe the various event handlers that intercept user interaction with the web page.
    - Use event handlers to activate JavaScript functions.
    - Use JavaScript for controlling form submission.

5. Write scripts that use built-in browser objects.
    - Identify various objects that are available in the browser.
    - Discuss the various methods and properties available for working with these objects.
    - Use these built-in objects within scripts to enhance the web page functionality.

6. Write scripts that store, retrieve, update, and delete data using browser localStorage, and trigger events using timers.
    - Explain how localStorage are used to store data in the browser and make it available to the server.
    - Use localStorage to persist web page data beyond a single request.
    - Demonstrate how to create, modify and delete localStorage.

7. Use advanced JavaScript to add animation and complex functionality to pages.
    - Describe advanced features of JavaScript.
    - Explain how the sizing and positioning features of Cascading Style Sheets can be accessed and modified from JavaScript to create dynamic animation features.
    - Use Cascading Style Sheet positioning, the Document Object Model, and JavaScript event handling to build dynamic HTML features into a web page.

8. Use Asynchronous JavaScript and JSON to make web pages dynamic.
    - Explain how tags such as “div” can be controlled to provide dynamic size, position, and contents changes after the main page isloaded.
    - Describe the mechanism used by JavaScript to communicate asynchronously with servers and update page regions.
    - Use the Fetch API to dynamically update web page regions using asynchronous communications with web servers.

9. Use Object-Oriented patterns to structure web applications.

    - Explain the history and purpose of Node.js.
    - Demonstrate the ability to set up a Node.js environment.
    - Use operators, built-in functions, and control structures to generate a web page.

    - Explain the web application architecture that enables the construction of web applications.
    - Describe the request/response mechanism for transferring data between clients and servers.
    - Create web forms in an HTML page and receive the data in a Node.js script on the server.
    - Use regular expressions to validate form data in a server script, generating a success page or an error page depending on validity.
